## Rutracker.org ![v1.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/v1.7-blue)
Biggest russian torrent tracker.

## Rutor.org ![v1.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/v1.5-blue)
Popular free russian torrent tracker.

## Kinozal.tv ![v2.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/v2.9-blue)
Russian torrent tracker mostly directed on movies, but have other categories.

The site has a restriction on downloading torrent files (10 by default or so), so I added the ability to open the magnet link instead the file.
You can turn off the magnet link: in `kinozal.json` switch `"magnet": true` to `"magnet": false`

## NNM-Club.me ![v2.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/v2.9-blue)
One of biggest russian torrent tracker.

## Troubleshooting
All errors will appear directly in qBittorrent as searching result.
* torrent tracker return 403 error:
  - Some sites, sometimes, enable protection like CloudFlare, that required JavaScript. Vanilla Python has no implementation of JavaScript, it means that search engine will be return 403 error.
